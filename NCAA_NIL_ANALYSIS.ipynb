As student-athletes gain the ability to earn compensation through sponsorships and endorsements, universities face increasing uncertainty around how NIL activity influences program competitiveness, recruiting dynamics, and financial performance.\n",
        "Our project aims to evaluate this emerging landscape by analyzing data on NIL deals, team performance, recruiting rankings, and program revenue. The goal is to identify measurable relationships between NIL activity and athletic or financial outcomes, enabling universities and stakeholders to make informed decisions about resource allocation, recruitment strategies, and long-term planning.\n"

It is responsible for setting competition rules, managing eligibility standards for student-athletes, and organizing major national championships including March Madness, one of the most watched sporting events in the country. The NCAA includes over 1,100 colleges and universities across three divisions, ranging from large powerhouse athletic programs to smaller schools with limited resources.\n",

        "Historically, the NCAA controlled athlete compensation, but recent policy changes such as NIL (Name, Image, and Likeness) rules have reshaped the college sports landscape by allowing student-athletes to earn money through endorsements, sponsorships, and personal branding."
